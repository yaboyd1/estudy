          Welcome to our project! We are a team of educators and technology
          enthusiasts who are passionate about using game-based learning to
          engage and inspire students. Our project was inspired by Kahoot, a
          popular platform for creating and playing quizzes, and discussions. We
          believe that learning should be fun and interactive, and we have
          designed our platform to reflect this philosophy. Our platform allows
          users to create and play their own quizzes or participate in those
          created by others. We are constantly innovating and updating our
          platform to provide the best possible experience for our users. We
          hope that you will join us on this journey and discover the power of
          game-based learning for yourself!
